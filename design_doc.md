    For our project the plan is to build a controller that can communicate with a computer game, which we plan to enter in OGPC. Our biggest problem will be trying to get the communication between the circuitry and the video game. As for the nature of the game, we are not completely sure since we do not know the topic for this year yet. The game will be programmed in Java and we plan on emailing David Anuta, who graduated last year but also made a game using a physical device, in order to get some information as to how he went about making the dancing game. Since we do not know about the topic for OGPC yet we will be working on menus, options and learning about what to use to build the circuitry and how to communicate between it and the computer.

    The Controller
    The controller will be a simple design with three or more buttons. The three necessary buttons being a select, which will also open menus, an up button, and a down button, to allow for movement. More keys might be added later on depending on the regulations for OGPC. At this point the controller will be built out of circuitry, but the design and the connection to the computer will depend on communication with David Anuta. Additionally the controller will provide input and be connected by a cord. 

    We also plan on working on the Abstract Algebra app but we are not sure what is going to be happening with that yet.
