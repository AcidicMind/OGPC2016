	For our project the plan is to build a controller that can communicate with a computer game, which we plan to enter in OGPC. Our biggest problem will be trying to get the communication between the circuitry and the video game. As for the nature of the game, we are not completely sure since we do not know the topic for this year yet. The game will be programmed in Java and we plan on emailing David Anuta, who graduated last year but also made a game using a physical device, in order to get some information as to how he went about making the dancing game. Since we do not know about the topic for OGPC yet we will be working on menus, options and learning about what to use to build the circuitry and how to communicate between it and the computer.

	The Controller
	The controller will be a simple design with three or more buttons. The three necessary buttons being a select, which will also open menus, an up button, and a down button, to allow for movement. More keys might be added later on depending on the regulations for OGPC. At this point the controller will be built out of circuitry, but the design and the connection to the computer will depend on communication with David Anuta. Additionally the controller will provide input and be connected by a cord. 

	We also plan on working on the Abstract Algebra app but we are not sure what is going to be happening with that yet.

	Supplies needed for the controller:
	
1 flora board;

3 buttons (depending on OGPC requirements);

coated wire;

case (hopefully 3-D printed)

Game Mechanics:
-Fight/Get pass monsters
-Damage monster
	-Increase Characterâ€™s strength
	-Possibility of companion being injured (character cannot heal companion(s))
-Sneak Pass Monster
	-Increase probability of being able to sneak
	-If fail to sneak pass, forced to fight (damage)
-If  Lose fight, 0 energy in Waste land



-Move
		-Take Energy
			-food replenishes
				-companion also needs, damages companion if food=0
		-Done with controller buttons

	-Save
		-only in cities or safe spot
-Interact
		-Takes energy
		-Includes fighting, sneaking, and any other time effect environment
	-Moral Decision
		-Beginning of Game: See unconscious person, decide if steal or not. Decide if take to village or not. Decision determines what will happen for rest of game if Energy=0 and pass out.

	-Increase Monster health each level, but not attack
	-Pokemon style attack
